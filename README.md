Kageetai Application Resume
============

I developed this resume for a joob application in the web development branch.
It uses [impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/) for the 3D transformations with CSS3.
The presesntion itself is quite simple and uses some transitions inside the slides.
The menu on the left was harder to do.

The code here is anonymized and just the companies I apply to get the code to unlock the personal information.
